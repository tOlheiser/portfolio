# Things I've Learned

My site is inspired by Brittany Chiang's portfolio site. Yes, I could fork her repo, but I'm rusty. I want firsthand experience with Gatsby, React Hooks, and Styled Components. Also, I feel that the best way to get better at coding is practice. This practice will give me a lot of momentum when I move onto other projects in my opinion.

## October 4th, 2020 - At a crossroads. CSS Modules or Styled Components?
In developing my portfolio site, I was VERY rusty with React to begin with, have no familiarity with Gatsby.js, and this is also my first time working with Hooks. 

**Stumbling Block #1: CSS Modules feel... clunky.** I've noticed that requiring a CSS file to style one or two elements felt cumbersome when this is something you find yourself doing often. When I first learned of Styled Components, it looked VERY strange. But after reading about it more and more, it's something I'd like to try.
