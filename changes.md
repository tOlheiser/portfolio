# Changes I'd Like to Make

## Nav Bar & Hero Image

* Use a photo of me as the Hero image. Put a tint over it to darken the photo, making the content pop out.
* Hide the nav bar onload, only showing Nav Links over-top of the Hero Image. 
* Make the 'active' styles of the link a different colour. Change the active style on scroll.
* (unsure) Reveal an alternative version of the nav bar on scroll. I like how Atulesh does it. http://www.atulesh.com/
* (unsure) Do I put my social links in the nav bar?
* Include only one call to action button, which is to 'See my work'. https://youtu.be/1D4FzPcEiN4?list=PL0lNJEnwfVVM80SBgWyC_1DQqyBYfiXeF&t=202 
* Include a 'Portfolio' link at the top, with a hamburger menu housing secondary links. https://youtu.be/1D4FzPcEiN4?list=PL0lNJEnwfVVM80SBgWyC_1DQqyBYfiXeF&t=234 
* May be better to display work off the top - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D4FzPcEiN4&list=PL0lNJEnwfVVM80SBgWyC_1DQqyBYfiXeF&index=20&t=0s

**Hero Image** - The hero image should be a photo of me orientated on the right. Bonus points if I'm able to animate the background, wallpaper engine style.

**Animation** - The content should be delayed. It should slide in from the left, and after it slides in, certain text should change colour to suit the theme.

## Portfolio

I'm planning to have 6-8 projects listed on my portfolio. Each project would have a thumbnail, title, brief description, icons of tech used, and a link to the live demo. *Perhaps when I hover, I can display a play icon. When clicked, it displays a gif.*

### Project Card

* I intend to display my project cards across two columns. Because I'm doing this, I plan on having my cards have some sort of background/border. 
* Showcase how the project looks on desktop & mobile like this guy did - http://www.portfoliotips.co/design-tips-from-isaac-paavolas-portfolio/
* I should have a single, concise sentence describing who I build the app for, and what it does. 
* There should be three buttons: 'Demo', 'Github Icon' that links to the project page, and 'Learn More'. Learn More is the project's page, where I have a case study & multiple gifs of me using the site (sign up, upload ticket, etc).
* Built With: Beneath my project description, have a small 'Built With' header that lists icons of the technologies used in a row. On hover, it displays what the icon represents. (Hovering over the react icon displays a 'React.js' tooltip.)

## About Me & Skills

This section will be split into two columns. The About Me section must come off as authentic as possible, talking about my background and such. The Skills section can be comprised of 4 cards: Front-end, Back-end, Database, and Tooling. As I scroll down, reveal the skills cards via animation.

Aaron Jacks skills section is solid - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEjqdodOWOk&feature=youtu.be&t=600.

## Blog 

Right off the bat, because my project cards are horizontal (as having the content parallel with the photo) I want to make my blog cards vertical. 

* I'd like there to be an effect when I hover over a card, not just the image.
* Use different fonts.
* The button should be polished.

## Contact Me

* Buttons and Focus elements should have interactivity.
* Contact info should be updated.
* When I focus on a text field, there is no blinking cursor. Letters are typed from the edge on the left.
