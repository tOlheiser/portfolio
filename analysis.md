A video by 'DesignCourse' on YouTube suggested that your portfolio should go immediately below your hero image.

## Thoughts On Each Section

**Nav Bar** - I'm thinking that it stands out too much, in a bad way. Either:
* Make it smaller.
* Make it a different colour (white, or a green that isn't as 'in your face').
* Place the navigation links over-top of the hero image.
* When I hover over the logo, the inverse colour version of the logo should appear.

**Hero Image**
* I'd much rather use a photo of myself as the hero image as opposed to something generic.
* Overall, I like the font and content, thought I may need to make it standout more with shadows. The content may need to be smaller &or positioned differently with a new image.
* The call-to-action buttons are good, although the style and interactivity of them must be polished.

**About Me** - The content doesn't really feel authentic. While it should be kept down to two paragraphs, I should be addressing my background, why I'm interested in web development, what I'm working on, address that I blog, etc.
* The social links feel ugly and big.
* **Skills** - I'd like to split my 'About Me' section into two columns: 'Background' and 'Skills'. The skills will use visuals to display my tech stack & tools I'm familiar with.

**Portfolio**
* The thumbnails suck + there is no interactivity.
* I think I'd rather use 'Portfolio' as a header instead of 'Recent Work'.
* I'd like to go with 6-8 projects.

**Blog** - I think the cards are alright.
* I'd like there to be an effect when I hove over a card, not just the image.
* Use different fonts.
* The button should be polished.

**Contact Me**
* Buttons and Focus elements should have interactivity.
* Contact info should be updated.
* When I focus on a text field, there is no blinking cursor. Letters are typed from the edge on the left.
